## Introduction

### Goal
The project is conducted from the perspective of the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, tasked with overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States.

The goal is to design a workflow (repeatable as data is published) and create a dashboard which captures:
- A snapshot of the last month, and
- The trends from the last quarter.

The intent is to generate the dashboard and report as the dataset is published monthly, to provide city officials the insights to make decisions regarding the publicity and improvement of the city program.

### Repository Structure
- `output` directory contains the cleaned datasets
- `resources` directory contains the raw datasets

The root directory contains the Jupyter notebooks:
- `data_cleaning.ipynb`
- `workflow.ipynb`

### Dataset
Citibike Program System Data sourced from [https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)
